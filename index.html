        It’s Ryan.<br>
        ...<br>
        Laughter<br>
        ...<br>
        Wait what does that mean, exactly?<br>
        ...<br>
        So, how would that become a music composition? Can you tell me one more time I don’t get it.<br>
        ...<br>
        Yeah, yeah.<br>
        ...<br>
        Got it.<br>
        ...<br>
        That’s cool.<br>
        ...<br>
        Laughter<br>
        ...<br>
        Laughter<br>
        ...<br>
        It looks like a figure.<br>
        ...<br>
        Like a figure.<br>
        ...<br>
        Yeah it does.<br>
        ...<br>
        Is it playing?<br>
        ...<br>
        I keep telling you this, but, you can always just convert the images to raw bytes, and the raw bytes into sound, and see what it sounds like.<br>
        ...<br>
        Yeah. Just a thought. And also: metronomes.<br>
        ...<br>
        Oh, metronomes are so fascinating, yeah.<br>
        ...<br>
        It seems like it’s sort of funny. I can’t really figure out, like, how you pick something, it’s almost like, and I can’t tell if you’re working with systems or logics or languages, you know, maybe they’re entangled together or something, because it’s almost like you can take any piece of text or configuration or shape or something, and then apply or find some sort of logic, or like, making a move, or like taking it apart or something. It’s just, it’s sort of un—I’m trying to like, is it just, random, what you’re doing, like the piano book? Like, you know, you know I’m just wondering where does the attraction sort of start with you to work with something, you know? I mean, you don’t have to answer that—<br>
        ...<br>
        Right, right. I mean, maybe it’s great if you don’t.<br>
        ...<br>
        I really love the fact that you’re adapting your music teacher’s book. I think that there’s something, it’s such a beautiful project, and I just love the way that you’re giving meaning to every passage that was written, and like, I just like that you’ve got a relationship and you’re kind of slidifying it in a graphic kind of way. I feel like that work’s really strong. Like, all of the work is really strong, but. I also wish I could have sat here and read that book for the whole time, because I’m so nosy, and—<br>
        ...<br>
        It’s such a fascinating,					    book though, right?<br>
        ...<br>
        Oh sorry, it’s just kind of like, the comments are just sort of interesting because it’s like, “Shosta”—“Shostakovich: good!; another one: bad!” It’s like really fascinating, right? Sorry, I had to cut in because I agree with you.<br>
        ...<br>
        No, no, go for it.<br>
        ...<br>
        Laughter.<br>
        ...<br>
        What’s the time-checking list?<br>
        ...<br>
        I feel like you could just write a piece out of this book, because there are so many um, notes on um, like, your technique, in terms of like, staccato versus slide down, versus like, the dynamics, and then there are actual notes in here as well, in particular like, there is an e flat, b flat, and then there’s tempo in the dates, as well. I feel like this itself is—<br>
        ...<br>
        —yeah, um. The dates themselves are tempos. and then are are like, important events, like the tests, or the recitals, I don’t know. Those are like, high parts of a score. I don’t know. I think it seems very natural to me to just make a composition out of this.<br>
        ...<br>
        Why do you choose black and white?<br>
        ...<br>
        I have a question, just looking at these right now. Have you thought about shining light through them, and projecting them?<br>
        ...<br>
        It reminds me, and especially because we were reading through the old notebook—it reminded me of kids in school. I don’t know if, when I was in school, they would have these as like, slides that you would put into the projector, and then they would light them up?<br>
        ...<br>
        Yeah.<br>
        ...<br>
        It kind of reminds me of that, but like, yeah, I don’t know.<br>
        ...<br>
        I think how you’ve turned all of these into some type of video, or like, moving image, also helped to kind of unconstrain them, and I think in terms of finding a way to actually present these in an exhibition, the videos look like a really good direction.<br>
        ...<br>
        I also just love the term time fields, like, it feels like a “force field,” or like, a portal to walk into, or like, I don’t know, kind of just like, time machine. I don’t know, so maybe thinking about taking out that kind of imagery may be interesting.<br>
        ...<br>
        I guess I have two questions, but, in your um, piano teacher’s notebook, there was a point where the handwriting changed, I was wondering if you knew, why?<br>
        ...<br>
        Laughter.<br>
        ...<br>
        Whoa, that’s so great.<br>
        ...<br>
        Whoa.<br>
        ...<br>
        It’s like a dance floor made out of time<br>
        ...<br>
        I love the self-binding.<br>
        ...<br>
        I’m of course, sort of like, interested in like, how color will, I mean, whether you’re going to let it seep in, or whether you’re going to find some way to let it just stay escaping color, because you know, color of course is another language, and again, like, are you going to work with that with like a system, or like, I guess there is an intuition that’s sort of involved, and maybe that’s how you choose. Like, maybe it’s just like, intuitive, you know. Maybe there’s something in just, you know, allowing yourself, whatever that might be, that pleasure.<br>
        ...<br>
        I think that’s really up to you. I think that the more legible you make it, the more easy it is to tell what it is right away, and the less time people will spend on it. And if you really want them to spend at least a good half hour at your show, or you want them to just take a break and fully process it, then I think that maybe like, maybe being a bit more vague would be better.<br>
        ...<br>
        I think you need to kind of give people enough to keep looking, because, if they are met with something that they just don’t understand, they won’t take, or, I feel like—and I”m a skeptic—I feel like people won’t take the time to try and understand it. I think like, signifiers are important.<br>
        ...<br>
        I agree with that, but, I think that like, I think Tobi’s point, and also the sweet spot of time which is like, indicating that you want the viewer to put in the same amount of time and care as your teacher did, especially with that work, but still having it accessible to people who can understand it if they want to, if that makes sense.<br>
        ...<br>
        I think, to some degree it varies though, because I really like this kind of like, like narrative you’ve got going on with codes and codification of information. If you look at music notation, just as a like a code, and this year-long calendar as another code, like, you asked us if we could figure it out, and I think that spot will range differently for different individuals. So I think there is some play that you have there, and I don’t think you have to dumb anything down, or necessarily make anything explicitly legible.<br>
        ...<br>
        Also I feel like if you don’t make legibility your focus, and it’s just a natural side effect of your focus—like, I feel like since you’re working with time, time is very much a feeling, and less so something that is legible or textual. If you’re focusing on the feeling that you’re creating and giving people, the legibility should naturally come, from time.<br>
        ...<br>
        You know, I think it’s interesting like, seeking out the softness, out of those notes, and I almost want to seek out the softness out of this thing, too. But you do need to go into it to find it, because it looks very harsh from the outside, like, it looks like a calendar, you know. And those things are usually not that, soft, very objective, um, yeah. So maybe that’s the best way to do it—to like, bring out the extremes.<br>
        ...<br>
        You’re such a good student. All these A-pluses. <br>
        ...<br>
        Laughter.<br>
        ...<br>
        I’ve only seen, like, two A’s, and I’m almost finished. And all these hearts? Oh my god.<br>
        ...<br>
        I guess I just feel like you should just focus on the work that you want to make. You know, it’s sort of that simple. And, you know, this a chance to do that, you know. You’re going to be surrounded by some people who don’t know or are like whatever, but I don’t know. It’s a different project to make something legible. It’s just a completely different project.<br>
        ...<br>
        Well, it will come.<br>
        ...<br>
        Right.<br>
        ...<br>
        Right, I mean. Well, uhhg. I mean—allow yourself to be confused. That’s the nature of what artists do. I understand that like, the way forward is simpler if there’s some sort of like, clarity, you know, but clarity can come from a different form, you know. Like from another text that you read, or from something somebody says to you, or a poem, or—you know, it doesn’t have to be like “my work is about bla bla bla,” you know? But, I don’t know, everybody will have a different opinion about that, you know. But I think that you will start to understand the work as you go.<br>
        ...<br>
        You can write about it too. That’s helpful sometimes. I don’t know. Brandon, do you have ideas about that?<br>
        ...<br>
        About.. About what?<br>
        ...<br>
        About like, uh, you know, about like, understanding your work. You know, the struggle to kind of go forward when you don’t really completely know what you’re doing? Sorry, that wasn’t completely your words that you used, but<br>
        ...<br>
        Um, I mean, I’m really stubborn so I just kind of go. I just keep going, I think. But, I think, you do and you don’t—is that what you—like, what do you do when you don’t know what you’re doing?<br>
        ...<br>
        No, just like your thoughts on it. Like I’m like, I’m like you—I’m not afraid to get lost in the work, but you know, everybody has to find their own position in that, you know?<br>
        ...<br>
        Yeah, yeah. Oh, ok. Um, I think I can hit—I think one universal thing is that no one can fully bring you to your work, like no matter how many visits and stuff like that, because no one’s really ruminating as long as you are about your own work, and then I think two—this issue I think about legibility—um, I don’t know. I always just assumed that like, if people, yeah, like everybody else’s comments. Like if people look long enough, they’ll kind of arrive even at the same confusion that you are. They’ll kind of meet you at the junction. I guess to say, like, that’s kind of the nature of what we are doing, anyway, is sort of like, making this alphabet soup of like, miscommunications, and dreams, and memories. We’re all kind of piecing it together all the time, with visual language, which its own—I also always assume that a big chunk of the population just doesn’t really speak that language and that’s fine. But yeah, I think that the more mutations and permutations that happen in the studio, it’s so funny. Like, you can look back at your work now, and like, five years from now, you’ll still see the project and be like, oh, I definitely didn’t know what I was doing then, but it like, follows you. So that’s that keeping going thing, is like when stuff doesn’t make sense, it’s good to keep one or two mementos, or like notes, or just like stuff from the time when you didn’t know what you were doing, because it will look different<br>
        but intrinsically you’ll know where you started and arrived with that. And yeah, I just like, the nature of just making art—legibility is never 100% certain. Like, people can read a phrase and think of a multitude of different associations and meanings to a viewer, so yeah. I don’t know. I try to like, I don’t know. It’s also just like the perfect time to be selfish, when making art, because I just assume that no one else is really looking at it, except me. Um, so, yeah. I don’t know. It’s like, we can have that book with you, but there’s a disconnect when it’s not your stuff. And you’re not like, giving a lecture, you know, so it’s a little different what the expectation is of what is to come afterwards, you know what I mean? So like, yeah. It sorts itself out—or it doesn’t, and then you know to pivot, or what to add or what to subtract, but, yeah. I don’t know.<br>
        ...<br>
        I know, you said everything.<br>
        ...<br>
        Laughter.<br>
        ...<br>
        I think that’s our night.<br>
